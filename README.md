# The GAP 4 package `GaloisGroups'

This package implements the computation of Galois group.

For arithmetic computations, the package relies on
[PARI/GP](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/)  called via the PARIInterface
package.

## Requirements

GaloisGroups depends on other Galois packages

- GAPDoc
- Digraphs
- ferret
- alnuth
- TransGrp
- PARIInterface

as well as the development version of PARI/GP (see Installation below)

## Installation

For the moment you need to use the development version of pari
that implement function unavailable in PARI/GP 2.11 (e.g. `ZpXQX_liftroots`).
If you need the compiler to know about a special location of PARI/GP runs
configure with appropriate options

    $ ./configure [GAPPATH] [--with-pari=PARIPATH]


## Documentation

Full information and documentation can be found in the manual, available
as PDF `doc/manual.pdf` or as HTML `doc/chap0_mj.html`, or on the package
homepage at
